# Lightweight GUI for OSM lightweight build 

This project focuses on the implementation of a web GUI to interact with the Northbound API of OSM lightweigth build. 

The project is based on ([RDCL 3D](https://github.com/superfluidity/RDCL3D)), a web framework for the design of NFV services and components. The framework allows editing,
validating, visualizing the descriptors of services and components both textually and graphically.
